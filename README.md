# product-chatbot-ui

Uses Streamlit to provide a chatbot front end to DataStax's product catalog RAG / Vector Search basics notebook.

Deployed chatbot is at https://appuct-chatbot-ui-dp22disdhqmss7zcdqnvzd.streamlit.app/

Currently a bad practice, my SCB is part of the github repo.  I could not get the curl download to work within Streamlit.  I know there is a UI to upload files (e.g. for the PDF serach examples where you upload your PDF) but I did not not get time to implement.  I have remvoed the SCB from the repo after deployign the app.
